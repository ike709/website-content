### XenoArcheology
*Contributed by EmoGarbage404*

Artifacts have gotten a big overhaul with the introduction of XenoArcheology! A new subdepartment of Science, XenoArch revolves around exploring the graph-like structure of artifacts; each node is randomly generated with its own effects and triggers. Unlocking these nodes generates points, but be careful! The artifact might throw you, shatter windows, deliver a carp straight to your face, or just leave you in a bad mood: the possibilities are endless!

These changes also include an overhauled tech tree and a variety of new machines and items. Go do some science and discover all the new goodies!

### RIPLEY Mechs
*Contributed by EmoGarbage404*

After several years of over-budget and misguided development, the science team has finally created Cargo's beloved mech, the Ripley. For use only for sanctioned cargo transfer (but who cares about the rules?)

### Button & Airlock Device Linking
*Contributed by rolfero*

Engineering uncrossed some wires in the airlock circuitry, so now you can link buttons and levers to them and windoors. Assuming you have access, of course.

### Target Dummies & Practice Guns
*Contributed by Daemon*

After repeated friendly-fire incidents, Central Command has decided to supply Security with a variety of practice targets and a practice laser gun. All officers are encouraged to spend some time at the range. A subsequent request for clarification confirmed that tying up the Clown for target practice is still permitted as long as non-lethal weaponry is used.

## Minor Changes
Due to length constraints, not everything can get a dedicated section in the progress report and instead will be found listed here.

As of Progress Report 39, the Minor Changes section is now auto-generated from SS14's in-game changelog. So if you read the changelog, you won't see anything new here and you can skip to the next section.
