### Surpassing /tg/station 13
*Contributed by everyone*

Space Station 14 is officially being developed at a faster pace than the most active SS13 codebase, /tg/station. At the time of writing SS14 has 520 merged and 50 open pull requests (code changes) in the last 30 days, compared to 326 merged and 106 open for /tg/.

And that's not even counting changes to Robust Toolbox.

### Gun Refactor
*Contributed by metalgearsloth, ElectroSR, taral & probably others*

Guns have been refactored in their entirety. In fact there's been so many changes to guns over the course of June that we, your benevolent Progress Report authors, lost track of them all.

Here's the highlights:

- Guns now have clientside prediction and are more responsive
- Updated hitscan effects
- Updated sprites
- Added fire rate selectors (e.g. semi-auto and full-auto)
- Rebalanced the weight, accuracy, and bullet spread of many guns to give different types (i.e. rifles versus SMGs) more distinction. These changes are ongoing.
- Cleaned up gun code a lot to enable sillier and more unique guns
- Added a development tool for visualizing bullet spread

### Item Pricing & Piracy
*Contributed by moony*

Most things now have prices assigned allowing Cargo to, for example, sell fuel tanks for a couple hundred spacebucks. Consequentially, an increase of space piracy has been detected in the sector.

Attempts to kidnap and sell the Clown will be refused by Central Command.

### Drug & Drunk Shaders
*Contributed by ElectroSR*

To save costs and improve employee morale, Central Command has disabled the drug & alcohol inhibitors embedded in everyone's spinal cord, and both vices should now have much more substantial effects. Employees are reminded to avoid getting absolutely blasted while they're on the clock.

Here's what the drug effects look like (Author's Note: This is not what it looks like IRL):

### Department Radios
*Contributed by Morb0, ElectroSR, metalgearsloth, & notafet*

Engineering finally bothered to install the rest of the station's telecommunications equipment, and the network now has sufficient bandwidth for departmental radio channels. The crew can now yell exclusively at their own department instead of trying to talk over each other on the Common frequency all the time.

### Modular Landmines
*Contributed by mirrorcult*

The lads down in the Department of Interstellar War Crimes™ have developed a new modular landmine platform which accepts customized payloads. Casualties guaranteed or your money back!

Make sure to watch your step.

### Rat King
*Contributed by mirrorcult & EmoGarbage404*

His royal highness the Rat King has been spotted in maintenance aboard Space Station 14. The King and his loyal servants intend to eat the entire station's food supply while leaving plague and rot in their wake. Research & Development has been tasked with developing extra-large mousetraps.

### Cargo Shuttle, Evac Shuttle, & Docking Interface
*Contributed by metalgearsloth*

Shuttles have finally arrived! Unlike their SS13 predecessors, the shuttles Actually Move™ and can be piloted around. The Cargo Techs now have an additional responsibility — they need to remotely bring the cargo shuttle in for docking once it arrives from Central Command. There's also a fancy docking interface to make that easier.

Try to avoid slamming into any Salvage Miners!

### Projectile Spells
*Contributed by mirrorcult*

Wizards have found some new ancient tomes with detailed information on casting projectile spells, fireballs, and the like. Be sure to cast Dodge™ whenever one is headed your way!

### Jetpacks
*Contributed by metalgearsloth & lzimann*

Nuclear Operatives and crewmembers should have an easier time getting around during EVAs thanks to a brand new set of jetpacks.

### Miasma
*Contributed by Rane*

*"For when the morning breezes blow toward the town at sunrise, if they bring with them mist from marshes and, mingled with the mist, the poisonous breath of creatures of the marshes to be wafted into the bodies of the inhabitants, they will make the site unhealthy." - Vitruvius*

Rotting corpses will now produce miasma, a toxic and disease-ridden gas. Proper corpse disposal (or even just putting them on ice) is now essential for the crew's health.

### Space Dragons & Sushi
*Contributed by CrudeWax*

Salvage miners have discovered a new species of space fauna: the Space Dragon! How does a dragon fly in the vacuum of space? Why is it allied with Space Carp? Who cares!

In response, the Chef has been armed with a variety of recipes for turning space carp into sushi.

### Forensics
*Contributed by Rane, Soupstraw, & ike709*

Security has been equipped with a set of forensic scanners that can detect the fingerprints or glove fibers that any pesky criminals leave behind at a crime scene. Preliminary reports indicate that chain-smoking while using the scanner doubles the likelihood of solving crimes while only tripling the likelihood of lung cancer. Now *that's* efficiency!

## Technical
### Entity Creation Optimizations
*Contributed by PJB*

While many people would already say that SS14 runs better than BYOND SS13, there are still many performance problems. A lot of the core engine has some poor design that could do with a tune up.

One of the biggest problems were consistent stutters when moving around. This is because the networking system currently sends new entities from the server on chunk boundary, and these stutters were the result of new entities being *really* expensive to instantiate. There was some easy low-hanging fruit to grab at here that immediately stood out in a profiler, but the actually involved work here was related to optimizing event bus.

**Event bus** is the system that dispatches gameplay logic events. It has the ability to dispatch "directed" events on entities, based on the components said entities have. In short, a system can subscribe to an event:

```csharp
SubscribeLocalEvent<LightReplacerComponent, InteractUsingEvent>(HandleInteract);
```

And then these events can be sent on an entity like this:

```csharp
var interactUsingEvent = new InteractUsingEvent(user, used, target, clickLocation);
RaiseLocalEvent(target, interactUsingEvent, true);
```

The table of events to raise on which components is stored per-entity, since we assume each entity can have its own set of components. A large amount of work on entity creation was building this table incrementally.

The low hanging fruit (so somewhat medium hanging) is removing special "component events" from the tables. These are events like `ComponentAdd` which are sent only to one component at once (as opposed to all listening components on an entity). They don't use the regular event tables, but were still being tracked there uselessly. This already cut down a massive amount of subscriptions, saving work and memory.

The real problem to tackle is the data layout of the event table itself. Previously, the data was stored like this:

```csharp
// eUid -> EventType -> { CompType1, ... CompTypeN }
internal Dictionary<EntityUid, Dictionary<Type, HashSet<CompIdx>>> _entEventTables = new();
```

(a `CompIdx` is a simple integer that maps 1:1 to a component type. A little faster and more compact to work with in some cases)

Realistically, the only thing we need to be able to do is to iterate the list of subscribed components. We do not need properties like O(1) delete and unique keys from `HashSet<T>`. Allocating a bunch of these hash sets is *expensive*, and most of them don't contain much data.

A more optimal data structure is a simple linked list of subscriptions:

```csharp
internal Dictionary<EntityUid, EventTable> _entEventTables = new();

internal sealed class EventTable
{
    private const int InitialListSize = 8;

    // Event -> { Comp, Comp, ... } is stored in a simple linked list.
    // EventIndices contains indices into ComponentLists where linked list nodes start.
    // Free contains the first free linked list node, or -1 if there is none.
    // Free nodes form their own linked list.
    // ComponentList is the actual region of memory containing linked list nodes.
    public readonly Dictionary<Type, int> EventIndices = new();
    public int Free;
    public EventTableListEntry[] ComponentLists = new EventTableListEntry[InitialListSize];

    public EventTable()
    {
        InitEventTableFreeList(ComponentLists, ComponentLists.Length, 0);
        Free = 0;
    }
}

internal struct EventTableListEntry
{
    public int Next;
    public CompIdx Component;
}
```

Iteration and insertion are now even easier to do than before, because linked lists are very easy to work with. Removal is O(n) now, but it probably won't ever be a problem.

Critically, we use a single array buffer to store the linked list data per entity. This drastically cuts down on the count of objects and complexity of the object graph, drastically reducing memory and GC overhead. Reminder that a heap object in .NET has 16 bytes of overhead, and hash sets are complex!

This system provides very good savings, but there is still a lot of things that can be improved about it. Ideally we would be able to pre-cache event tables for entity prototypes, so we can just copy-on-write the event tables when constructing entities. The current problem with this approach is that entity creation is still too dynamic (`AddComponent()` from inside component initializations...) which would make this complex and gnarly to implement. Making entity creation more rigid is on our mind, but it'll still take more work to be able to get there.
